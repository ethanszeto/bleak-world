> How about both. Let's start with mentally.
.
.
.
>> Routine erodes time, passing years carelessly. Monotony weathers the mind. But occasionally you find someone that breathes life into the world. Giving it colour. Giving it and movement. 
.

.
> Like a Prometheus of life, perhaps, of love?

>> If only Prometheus unwittingly brought fire to the heart of man.

> And physically?

>> Physically, I wish to be a bird, to simply fly away from the problems. Migrate from the monotony, the sadness, the disappointment. Build a nest somewhere safe and warm, with colour, with excitement.

> But unfortunately we must live with a bleak world, as a bird that can never nestle in tranquility.
