# manual

A project where I explore the depths of mathematics' application in game development. The project has no dependencies, and all mathematical functions are written manually, hence the name. 

## Mathematics Used:
- Perlin Noise
- Quintic Smoothstep Function
- Linear Interpolation
- Cubic Bezier
- Distance Formula

## Theory Used:
- Lazy Loading / Unloading
- Procedural World Generation
- Class Inheritence
- Method Overriding
- Spatial Hashing
